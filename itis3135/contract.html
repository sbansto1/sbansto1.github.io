    <h2>Contract</h2>
    <p>
      I, Sambhav “Sam” Banstola agree to abide by the terms of the course contract in my Spring 2026, ITIS 3135,
      Web-Based Application Design and Development with my instructor, Professor D.I. von Briesen.
      I understand that all work that I do on publicly available online tools will be available to the world,
      and will not put information there that is inappropriate for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep private.
      I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not logins or showing up for class.
      As such, failure to turn in assignments may show as absences.
      I also understand that given the structure and content of this class it’s possible to find many examples online
      or even view my classmates’ code directly.
      I swear that I will only use these resources to learn, and will not cut and paste code except where I have properly
      given credit (i.e. external libraries) and never from my classmates.
      Signed: Sambhav “Sam” Banstola, 02/14/2026
